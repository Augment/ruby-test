# Augment Backend Ruby Challenge

## Guidelines

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Solve the levels in ascending order
- Commit your code at the end of each level
- Once you are done, ping someone from Augment

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing**
that could work for the level you're currently solving.

Disclaimer: the levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have
to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements. A good way to solve
this is by using OOP and adding new layers of abstraction only when they become
necessary. Don't hesitate to write [shameless code][1] at first, and then
refactor it in the next levels.

We are interested in seeing code that is:
- Clean
- Robust
- Tested
- Extensible
