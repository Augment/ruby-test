# Level 5

This level is a little bit different: we are now looking for a Rails
application that helps us manage workers and shift.

We are expecting a link to a hosted Rails application that enable us to:
- Add and edit workers
- Add and assign shifts
- Consult shifts

The application should be as simple as possible (for example, authentication is
not expected), don't spend too much time on it.
